# Pomodoro task manager
This app helps improve productivity by enhancing concentration and avoiding distraction (coupled with Forest).
 
What this simple app can do?
- Add/Remove a task.
- View tasks.
- Start Pomodoro timer (25min) on a selected task.
- Stop it early (if you wish).
- Count the number of successful Pomodoro sessions.
- Reset the counter (for whatever reasons you might need).
- Play a sound when a Pomodoro session finish (it's in Japanese).
- Prompt to choose between taking a break or not after a successful session and choose how long the break is.
- Play a sound after the break ends.

Use this with Blocklist mode of [Forest app](https://www.forestapp.cc/) to avoid (social media) distractions for maximum productivity.

NOTE: - Make sure tkinter (sudo apt-get install python3-tk) and playsound (pip install playsound) are installed.
